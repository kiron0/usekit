**useKit** hooks are designed to be lightweight and dependency-free, allowing you to easily integrate them into your projects without any additional setup. Below are the steps to get started:

### Method 1: Copy-Paste

1. **Browse the Collection**: Visit the [hooks](/docs/hooks) page and find the hook you need.
2. **Copy the Hook**: Click on the hook you want to use and copy the code.
3. **Paste into Your Project**: Create a new file in your project's `hooks` directory (e.g., `use-local-storage.tsx`) and paste the code.
4. **Customize as Needed**: Modify the hook to fit your specific use case.

### Method 2: Using shadcn CLI (Recommended)

You can quickly add useKit hooks to your project using the shadcn CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://usekit.kiron.dev/k/[hookName]
```

Replace `[hookName]` with the name of the hook you want to add (e.g., `use-local-storage`).

This will automatically download the hook and add it to your project.
